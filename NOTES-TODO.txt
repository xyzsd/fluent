primary to-do list and notes/thoughts
=====================================

* EXAMPLES
   done    - renaming built-in functions
   done    - replacing implicit functions (e.g., DATETIME with TEMPORAL)
   done    - simple implicit functions via lambdas
   done    - how to set default options for a function
   done    - error handling examples (error handler for fluent bundle)

    - how to select on a list (cannot!!) but show how it can be accomplished by splitting messages into
            formatting items and selection

    - locale selection and fallback example.
            have two locales, and show how to switch and what happens.
            e.g., english & french.
            see end of this document for additional info



    * wiki/readme for:
        - why Fluent vs. ICU::MF or MF2
        - list support & why that's important
        - how to read in FTL
        - locale fallback (see below)
        - why should not use for critical controls :)
        - feature highlights
        - explicitly note dependencies (just one)
        - work on readme.md ****


   todo * 'pattern' vs. 'skeleton' keyword for TEMPORAL/OTHER

    * OSSRH release
    * release notification on reddit / also to fluent group (GH project) AFTER OSSRH release


* SIMD
    * note performance pitfalls
    * code improvements
        * SIMD blend overkill for skipBlankBlock
    * CRLF detection: determine best approach: load 2 vectors vs. shifting masks.
        also performance tests with CRLF line endings
    * doc notes: scalar first, simd optional (scalar fallback).
        SIMD not always faster, and much slower startup.

* FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS
    - experimental SIMD ...
    - list handling
    - JDK21 compatible

* Rendering Performance Optimizations (for next minor version)
    * Measurements: need good JMH tests for message rendering
        * effects of caching/cache performance
        * focus on common methods
            String, Numbers, Lists, DateTime/Temporal
    * potentially consider, depending upon measurements: bytecode generation or (likely easier) StringConcatFactory
        https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java9-string-concat?tab=readme-ov-file
        https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1520.html#string-concatenation-via-invokedynamic
    * better pre-sizing of StringBuilders ? keep track of size in pattern element? even if only approximate


* Locale fallback
     just use ICU:LocaleMatcher
        ICU:LocaleMatcher.Builder
     this would be provided by (end-user-supplied!)
        * directly specified in code
        * or, supplied by a configuration file with supported locales
        * or, by scanning file system/classpath
     LocaleMatcher.getBestLocale() to get closest-matching Locale

     NOTE: this is all handled by ICU; we should give an example BUT not much to code here.

     using LocaleMatcher, get tags, and file/resource would be:
         *  recommend a naming format: (tentative):
             myFtlFile_en-GB.ftl
             {basename}_{languagetag}.{extension}
